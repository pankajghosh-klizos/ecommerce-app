          I was a bit nervous to be buying a secondhand phone from Amazon, but I
          couldnâ€™t be happier with my purchase!! I have a pre-paid data plan so
          I was worried that this phone wouldnâ€™t connect with my data plan,
          since the new phones donâ€™t have the physical SIM tray anymore, but
          couldnâ€™t have been easier! I bought an Unlocked black iPhone 14 Pro
          Max in excellent condition and everything is PERFECT. It was super
          easy to set up and the phone works and looks great. It truly was in
          excellent condition. Highly recommend!!!ðŸ–¤
